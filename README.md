**Intro**
This project uses Express.js to set up a server for the WTWR website and connects to the Mongoose database. Using request methods like get(), post() and others we are able to process requests related to users and clothing items. In the handlers for these methods we use methods like find(), create() and findByIdAndUpdate() to retreive info, add info and update info in the database.

# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
